  <h3>Lyrics</h3>
  <p>We don't need no education<br>
  We don't need no thought control<br>
  No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br>
  Teachers, leave them kids alone<br>
  Hey, teachers, leave those kids alone<br></p>
  <p><strong>All in all you're just another <u>brick</u> in the wall<br>
  All in all you're just another <u>brick</u> in the wall</strong></p>
  <p>We don't need no education<br>
  We don't need no thought control<br>
  No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br>
  Teachers, leave them kids alone<br>
  Hey, teachers, leave those kids alone<br></p>
  <p><strong>All in all you're just another <u>brick</u> in the wall<br>
  All in all you're just another <u>brick</u> in the wall</strong></p>
  <p>Wrong, do it again<br>
  If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding<br>
  How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?<br>
  You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddy!</p>
