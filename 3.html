  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p>Musically speaking, “Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2” is much more varied and vibrant than the trilogy’s first installment.<br>
  As mentioned before, the musical styles of the “Brick in the Wall” trilogy reflect the development of Pink.<br>
  Whereas the music in “Part 1” is subdued and repetitive reflecting Pink’s budding self-awareness,<br> “Part 2” is much more energetic, musically echoing Pink’s lively adolescence and his developing artistic imagination.<br>
  And just as the band ironically conformed to the most popular musical genre at the time by giving the song a disco beat,<br> the carefully measure beat and still-repetitive rhythm suggest a young Pink also conforming to the conventions of building a wall.
  <br><br>The animated guitar solo – a sort of aural outburst of individual expression – breaks through the wall building for a moment,<br> but ultimately the song fades back to the sounds of the school yard and, above all else, the shouting teacher who continues to lord over the children’s lives,<br> yelling “Wrong, do it again!” and “Stand still laddie!”, before reinforcing the infamous lesson that,”If you don’t eat your meat, you can’t have any pudding”<br> (a line possibly alluding to the philosophical notion that you can’t have the good without the bad, that nothing would taste sweet if you didn’t have memories of bitter).<br><br> Interestingly,<br> the lively but still repetitive song structure (guitar rhythm / verse / chorus) and narrative cycle (teacher / mental revolution / conformity / teacher) rolls perfectly into the dull drone of the phone ringing,<br> briefly foreshadowing the events that take place in the transition between “Young Lust” and “One of My Turns” – events that sour an adult Pink on yet another social instituion: marriage.</p>
